**AskBITSians** is a web-based mentorship platform designed to bridge the gap between current students and the extensive alumni network of BITS Pilani. It provides a dedicated space for students to seek guidance, and for alumni to give back to the community by sharing their valuable experience.

## Key Features

-   **Alumni Discovery**: Students can browse and filter a directory of registered alumni based on their company, job title, graduation year, and areas of expertise.
-   **1:1 Chat System**: Once a connection request is approved, students and alumni can engage in private, real-time conversations for personalized mentorship.
-   **Community Forum**: A public space for students to post questions that can be answered by the entire community, creating a shared, searchable knowledge base.
-   **Secure Request Workflow**: A formal request system (`Pending` -> `Approved`) ensures that alumni can manage their availability and connections.
-   **User-Specific Dashboards**: Separate views and functionalities for students and alumni.
